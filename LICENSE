This software HAS NOT OFFICIALLY been released. I screamed that to make it
clear. It's available online via github because I see no point in keeping it
on a harddrive that could crash tomorrow. This does lead to a bit of a
problem...

Be forewarned, I haven't gotten to picking a license yet, but it will be
either MIT style or copyleft style (think GPL).

In the interum, this software is released under the following copyleft-ish
license:

Copyright (C) 2012 G.T. Stobbe
This software and its source may be used and distributed freely, under the
following four terms:
1) This license and copyright notice must be retained in any distribution of
   this software or any derived work, and must be readily accessible by any
   end-user of any finished product.
2) The full source of this software, or any derived works must at all times
   be readily available to the public regardless of commercial purpose.
3) This software is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind, express
   or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability,
   fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement. In no event shall the
   authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages or other
   liability, whether in an action of contract, tort or otherwise, arising
   from, out of or in connection with the software or the use or other
   dealings in the software.
4) All derived works must have licenses which inherit all four licensing
   requirements as defined by this agreement, including this one, without
   modification or contradiction. Additional licensing terms which do not
   conflict with these terms may be added at will for derivative works.
